# Find your polling station (Afstemningssted) Web Page 

This project is intended to help voters in Denmark find their polling station, if they have 
lost or not received their voter card via mail. This page uses data publicly available via 
Dataforsyningen and DAWA for autocompleting addresses in Denmark. The page is available here:
[https://aprisak.github.io/Afstemningssted/](https://aprisak.github.io/Afstemningssted/).

This is also my first try at using React to build a Web Page, so please comment if you see things 
that can be improved.

For the DAWA autocomplete I have modified the code available here under the MIT license: 
[https://github.com/DanmarksAdresser/dawa-autocomplete2](https://github.com/DanmarksAdresser/dawa-autocomplete2)
